## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Matteo Neri, a PhD student working at the crossroad between neuroscience, AI, network science and mathematics. 

I am currently working on [HOI](https://github.com/brainets/hoi) a python toolbox that allow researchers to employ information theoretic metrics to investigate higher-order interactions.
